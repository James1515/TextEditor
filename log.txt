# and text-processor written in C99 (1999)
# for Linux distributions. 

==================================================
PHASE 1:

CREATING THE INITIAL PROGRAM
==================================================

#Date: 12/21/2019
- Created file called kilo.c
- Used kilo.c with echo to test output
- Did not need to install GCC as this comes with the 
linux distribution. 
- Created initial makefile for program


makefile commands:
- $(CC) is a variable that make expands to cc by default.
-Wall stands for “all Warnings”, and gets the compiler to 
warn you when it sees code in your program that might not technically be wrong, but 
is considered bad or questionable usage of the C language, like using variables before initializing them.

-Wextra and -pedantic turn on even more warnings. 
For each step in this log, if the program compiles, it shouldn’t produce 
any warnings except for “unused variable” warnings in some cases. 
If you get any other warnings, check to make sure your code 
exactly matches the code in that step.

-std=c99 specifies the exact version of the C language standard we’re using,
which is C99. C99 allows us to declare variables anywhere within a function, 
whereas ANSI C requires all variables to be declared at the top of a function or block.


First, attempt to read key processes from user:

-------------------------------------------
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	char c;
	while(read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) == 1);
	return 0;
}//end main

--------------------------------------------

*** read() & STDIN_FILENO 
Both are from: <unistd.h>
Whats occurring: We are asking read() to read 1 byte from the standard input into the variable c,
and to keep doing it until there are no more bytes to read. read() returns the
number of bytes that it read, and will return 0 when it reaches the end of a file.

What happens when running this program:
When running ./kilo, the terminal gets hooked up to standard input
and the keyboard input gets read into the c variable.

How to exit the above program:
Use Ctrl-D to tell read() that it has reached the end of the file.
Or, alternatively you can also press Ctrl-c.

=================================================
Phase 1 : Part 2

ADDING A COMMAND TO QUIT ('q')
=================================================


Now we want to demonstrate how canonical mode functions, 
we are able to do this by having the program itself exit when it reads 
'q' as input from the user.

-------------------------------------------------------
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
	char c;
	while(read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) == 1 && c != 'q');
	return 0;
}

-------------------------------------------------------


How to quit:
To quit the program you will need to type a line of text that 
includes a q in it, and then press enter. The program will quickly read the 
line of text one character at a time until it reads the 'q' 
as a single character. This will halt the while loop from continuing.

===============================================
Phase 1 : Part 3

TURN OFF ECHOING
===============================================

The user is able to set a teriminal's attributes by 
- Useing tcgetattr() to read current attributes into a struct
- Modifying the struct by hand
- Passing the struct to tcsetattr() to write 
the terminal attributes back out.

-----------------------------------------------------------
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void enableRawMode()
{
	struct termios raw;
	
	tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &raw);
	
	raw.c_lflag &= ~(ECHO);
	
	tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &raw);

} // end enableRawMode()



int main()
{
	enableRawMode();
	
	char c;
	while(read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) == 1 && c != 'q');
	return 0;
}//end MAIN

------------------------------------------------------------

Functions:
From <termios.h>
stuct termios, tcgetattr(), tcsetattr(), ECHO, TCSAFLUSH



The ECHO feature causes each key you type to be
printed to the terminal, so you can see what 
you’re typing. This is useful in canonical mode, 
but really gets in the way when we are trying to 
carefully render a user 
interface in raw mode. So we turn it off.

This program does the same thing as the one in the
previous step, the only difference is that it is
not printing out the characters as you are typing.

This is similar to what occurs when you are entering
a value wile using "sudo".

Terminal attributes are read by termios struct and 
tcgetattr(). After getting this value it is then later set
by tcsetattr() and applied to the terminal program.

The TCSAFLUSH argument specifies when to apply the actual change.
In this case, it waits for all pending output to be written to 
the terminal.

The c_lflag field is for "local flags" (miscellaneous flags)
Other flag fields include:
- c_iflag: input flags
- c_oflag: output flags 
- c_cflag: control flags

Echo
Echo is a bitflag.
In this case, it is defined as:
00000000000000000000000000001000
 
Useing the NOT bitwise operator on the value above we get:
11111111111111111111111111110111

We then use bitwise AND and this value forces the 4th bit
in the flags field to become 0.

==================================================
PHASE 1 : PART 4

DISABLE RAW MODE AT EXIT (To be continued....)
==================================================

In this section, we will restore the terminal's original
attributes when the program exits.

---------------------------------------------------
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>

struct termios orig_termios;

void disableRawMode()
{
	tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, $orig_termios);

}//end disableRawMode()

void enableRawMode()
{
	tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, $orig_termios);
	atexit(disableRawMode);
	
	struct termios raw = orig_termios;
	raw.c_lflag &= ~(ECHO);
	
	tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &raw);

}//end enableRawMode()

int main()  {...}
-----------------------------------------------------

atexit() comes from <stdlib.h>
We use this to register disableRawMode() to be 
called automatically upon exiting the program (or exit()
function.

orig_termios
We then stor the original terminal attributes in a 
global variable, orig_termios. We then assign 
the orig_termios struct to be the raw struct, so that
a raw copy can be made before making changes.

Notice that in this implementation, input is no longer
fed into the shell when after the program ends.

This is because TCSAFLUSH is being passed to tcsetattr()
when the program exits. This discards any unread input 
before applying the changes to the terminal.

=============================================================
PHASE 1: PART 5


TURNING OFF CANONICAL MODE
=============================================================

ICANON Flag
- There is an ICANON flag that allows us to turn off 
canonical mode . This will alows the users to read input 
byte by byte, instead of line-by-line.

--------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>

struct termios orig_termios;

void disableRawMode() { .... }

void enableRawMode() 
{
	tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &orig_termios);
	atexit(disableRawMode);
	
	struct termios raw = orig_termios;
	raw.c_lflag &= ~(ECHO | ICANON);
	
	tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &raw);
}

int main() { ... }
--------------------------------------------------------------


ICANON comes from <termios.h>.
Input flags (the ones in the c_iflags field will generally
start with I like ICANON does. However, ICANON is not 
an input flag, but actually a "local" flag in the c_lflag 
field. 

Now we have the program set in a way that allows us to quit as soon
as we press 'q' on the keyboard.




===============================================================
PHASE 1 : PART 6


DISPLAY KEYPRESSES
===============================================================

In order to get a better idea how input in raw mode works, 
lets print out each byte that we read with read(). We will 
print each character's numeric ASCII value, as well as the 
character that it represents if it is a printable character.


--------------------------------------------------------------
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>

struct termios orig_termios;

void disableRawMode() 	{...}
void enableRawMode() 	{...}

int main()
{
	enableRawMode();
	char c;
	while(read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) == 1 && c != 'q')
	{
		if(iscntrl(c)) //tests whether if ctrl char:
		{
			printf("%d\n", c);
		}
		else //if not, disp. actual char and ASCII#
		{
			printf("%d ('%c')\n", c, c);
		}
	}
	
	return 0;
}//end MAIN 

--------------------------------------------------------------

iscntrl()	 comes from <ctype.h>
printf()	 comes from <stdio.h>

*** iscntrl()
iscntrl() tests whether a character is a control character.
Control characters are non-printable characters that we don't want to 
print to the screen. ASCII codes 0-31 are all control
characters, and 127 is also a control character. All ASCII 
codes 32-126 are all printable.

*** printf()
printf() can print multiple representations of a byte. 
%d tells that a format of a byte is a decimal number 
(it's ascii code) and %c tells it to write the byte directly,
as a character. 

While useing this useful program you may notice a 
few interesting features:
Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End all input 
3 or 4 bytes to the terminal: 27, '[', and then one or two 
other characters. This is known as an escape sequence. 
All escape sequences start with a 27 byte. Pressing Escape sends a 
single 27 byte as input.
Backspace is byte 127. Delete is a 4-byte escape sequence.
Enter is byte 10, which is a newline 
character, also known as '\n'.
Ctrl-A is 1, Ctrl-B is 2, Ctrl-C is… oh, that terminates the 
program, right. But the Ctrl key combinations that do work 
seem to map the letters A–Z to the codes 1–26.

Below is an example of s small trial:
72 ('H')
101 ('e')
108 ('l')
